HOW THIS PROJECT WORKS:
    This project make a couple between the Game Engine Unity3D using the programing language C# and too wtih Phyton. 
    
    The Phyton was used to get coordenats of landmarks in your hand that is captured throut a webcam.
    This coordnates is put to a localServer that pass to an IP/PORT, UDP.
    With this coordnates, pass a list of etch finger, informing if they are raised or lowered.
    The library in Phyton tha make this capture is: HandTracking Module.
    Video where I lern and follow the steps to do this:
    
    On Unity3D, it receive that coordnates to a Script that manipule all the date and attatch eacth point of your hand in gameObjects. 
    In Scene of Unity, this points make the gameObjects transform they positions, building a semi-esqueleton hand type.
    Its possible to, use the compontent "LineRenderer" on all gameObjects, seting the began and the end of this lines to the points linked them, getting a better format of hand.
